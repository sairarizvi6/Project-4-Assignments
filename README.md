üìå Python Fundamentals & ANSI Escape Codes

00 - Introduction & Basic Python Scripts
Welcome to Python! This section introduces fundamental concepts such as syntax, variables, running Python scripts, displaying output, accepting user input, and performing basic calculations.

01 - Expressions
Expressions form the backbone of Python programming. This section explores mathematical operations, logical conditions, and variable manipulations to create meaningful computations.

02 - Lists
Lists are a fundamental data structure in Python. Here, you‚Äôll learn how to create lists, access elements using indexing and slicing, modify lists, and perform common operations like appending, sorting, and iterating through lists.

03 - Dictionaries
Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, making them a powerful tool for efficient lookups. This section covers dictionary creation, value retrieval, adding and removing elements, and iterating through dictionary items.

04 - If Statements
Decision-making is key to programming! This section explains how to use if, elif, and else statements to execute code conditionally based on logical expressions.

05 - Loops & Control Flow
Loops allow efficient execution of repetitive tasks. Learn how to use for and while loops, along with control flow mechanisms like break, continue, and pass to manage program execution.

06 - Functions
Functions promote modular and reusable code. This section covers function definitions, argument passing, return values, and best practices for writing clean, maintainable functions.

07 - Information Flow
Understanding how data moves within a program is crucial for efficient coding. This section delves into variable scope, data transfer between functions, and best practices for organizing code effectively.

üé® Enhancing Terminal Output with ANSI Escape Codes
What Are ANSI Escape Codes?
ANSI escape codes are special character sequences that allow you to control text formatting, colors, and cursor movement in terminal displays. These codes work seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and supported Windows terminals.

Why Use ANSI Escape Codes?
‚úÖ Add color to terminal output
‚úÖ Apply bold, italic, or underline styles
‚úÖ Improve readability and highlight key information
‚úÖ Reset formatting when needed

Common ANSI Escape Codes
Code	Effect
\033[0m	Reset formatting
\033[1m	Bold text
\033[3m	Italic text
\033[4m	Underlined text
\033[31m	Red text
\033[32m	Green text
\033[33m	Yellow text
\033[34m	Blue text
\033[1;33m	Bold Yellow
\033[1;34m	Bold Blue
Example Usage in Python
python
Copy
Edit
print("\033[1;34mBold Blue Text\033[0m")  # Bold Blue
print("\033[3;31mItalic Red Text\033[0m")  # Italic Red
print("\033[4;32mUnderlined Green Text\033[0m")  # Underlined Green
Output:
üîµ Bold Blue Text
üî¥ Italic Red Text
üü¢ Underlined Green Text

Why Use \033[0m?
Without resetting formatting, styles may persist in the terminal, affecting subsequent text.

‚ùå Without Reset:
python
Copy
Edit
print("\033[1mBold Text!")
print("Normal Text")  # This will also be bold!
The second line remains bold unintentionally.

‚úÖ With Reset:
python
Copy
Edit
print("\033[1mBold Text!\033[0m")
print("Normal Text")  # Now it's normal
Now, the second line returns to default formatting.

Additional ANSI Color Codes
Code	Color
\033[30m	Black
\033[31m	Red
\033[32m	Green
\033[33m	Yellow
\033[34m	Blue
\033[35m	Magenta
\033[36m	Cyan
\033[37m	White
Conclusion
ANSI escape codes provide a simple yet effective way to enhance terminal output. Whether you're formatting logs, debugging output, or styling CLI applications, these codes help improve clarity and readability.

üìå Tip: Windows Command Prompt does not support ANSI codes by default. Use Windows Terminal or enable ANSI support in PowerShell.

üí° Now, go ahead and add some style to your terminal outputs! üöÄ
